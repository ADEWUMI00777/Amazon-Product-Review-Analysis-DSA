# 🛍️ Amazon Product Review Analysis (DSA Project)

This repository contains a comprehensive product review analysis project completed as part of my training with the **Digital Skillup Africa (DSA) Data Analysis Program The Incubattor Hub**. The analysis was conducted using a dataset scraped from Amazon product pages. The goal was to generate actionable insights for product improvement, marketing strategies, and enhanced customer engagement.

## 🏢 Company Background

**RetailTech Insights** is a company that provides e-commerce analytics solutions to Amazon sellers. As a **Junior Data Analyst** on the team, I was tasked with analyzing a dataset of 1,465 Amazon products to uncover key patterns from customer reviews and product performance.

## 📦 Dataset Overview

- **Total Records:** 1,465  
- **Fields:** 16 columns  
- **Data Includes:**
  - Product Details: Name, Category, Price, Discount, Rating
  - Customer Engagement: Review Titles, Content, Number of Reviews
  - All reviewer data aggregated per product (CSV format in some fields)

---

## ✅ Analysis Tasks Completed

Using **Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables & Formulas)**, I performed the following:

1. Calculated average discount percentage by product category
2. Counted products listed under each category
3. Computed total number of reviews per category
4. Identified highest-rated products
5. Compared actual vs discounted prices by category
6. Ranked products by number of reviews
7. Counted products with 50% or more discount
8. Analyzed rating distribution (e.g., how many are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)
9. Estimated total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count)
10. Bucketed products by price range (<₹200, ₹200–₹500, >₹500)
11. Explored relationship between ratings and discounts
12. Counted products with fewer than 1,000 reviews
13. Identified categories with highest discounts
14. Combined rating and review count to highlight top 5 performing products
